# MSP430-telemetry-udp-send-from-i2c
This project incorporates an msp430g2553 MCU which calculates the input  signal for a servo,and relays the 2-byte result to a CC3200 Wireless MCU via i2c after request.  The cc3200 has an AP open where one can connect and receive the UDP packets with the telemetry.  This is the msp430 code.
